## Overview of the challenge
 
Giving a brief introduction, Web scraping is a technique used by software programs to extract information from websites. During this module, a script was generated that could collect all the relevant information about Mars on a web page created with Flask.
That said, we proceeded to use Chrome Developer Tools to identify the components of the web page from which the data was obtained and to be able to add them to the script. Later, the Python libraries called BeatifulSoup and Splinter were used to automate the data collection process. After that data was saved in a non-SQL database called MongoDB, this type of database was chosen, since the internet information comes in various formats, a SQL-type database will make the user have to write unnecessary code.
Finally, all the information was projected in a web application called Flask.
